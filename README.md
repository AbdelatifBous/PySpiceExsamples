# PySpiceExsamples
Collection of examples showing the usage of [PySpice]() and how to move beyond the limits of SPICE with python

The directory [MosfetTopologies](https://github.com/PyLCARS/PySpiceExsamples/tree/master/MosfetTopologies) contains a sort of "Blog" [AnalogMOSFET_Tobologies.ipynb](https://github.com/PyLCARS/PySpiceExsamples/blob/master/MosfetTopologies/AnalogMOSFET_Tobologies.ipynb) that shows examples and theory of various Mosfet Topologies that I am improving upon once a weel

While the directory [Operational AmplifierTopologies]() is another sort of "Blog" [OpAmpLearn.ipynb](https://github.com/PyLCARS/PySpiceExsamples/blob/master/Operational%20AmplifierTopologies/OpAmpLearn.ipynb) that shows examples of theory of various Operational Amplifier Topologies that I am improving upon once a week

The other material in this repository is some early work with PySpice where the necessary subfolder for the jupyter notebooks [BJTCurveTracerPySpice.ipynb](https://github.com/PyLCARS/PySpiceExsamples/blob/master/BJTCurveTracerPySpice.ipynb) and [DiodeConnectedMOFET.ipynb](https://github.com/PyLCARS/PySpiceExsamples/blob/master/DiodeConnectedMOFET.ipynb) is in the directory SpiceLib. 

Finlay  the notebook [SympyMOSModels.ipynb](https://github.com/PyLCARS/PySpiceExsamples/blob/master/SympyMOSModels.ipynb) is a Sympy equation generator for the Mosfet Equations
